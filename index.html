            <h2> Messi’s 2022 World Cup jerseys to go up for auction </h2>
            <img src="/images/Messi-jersey.webp" alt="Messi" id="messi-image" >
            <p> 
              A set of six jerseys that Lionel Messi wore during Argentina’s victorious 2022 World Cup run will be auctioned in December, Sotheby’s announced Monday, estimating their value at $10 million.
              The football star donned these shirts during the first halves of the group-stage rounds against Saudi Arabia and Mexico, as well as later games against Australia, the Netherlands and Croatia — and the final against France.
              Argentina’s winning run in Qatar last year was the final feather in the forward’s cap, having failed to secure the championship in four previous World Cups.
              If the jerseys indeed fetch above $10 million, that could make the sale the most valuable collection of sports memorabilia ever auctioned off, Sotheby’s said.
              The most expensive individual jersey ever sold at auction was one that basketball legend Michael Jordan wore during his NBA finals run with the Chicago Bulls in 1998.
              It sold for $10.1 million last year.

          <h2> Democracy was forced on Africa — Obasanjo </h2>
          <img src="/images/Obasanjo-e1700490312862.webp" alt="Obasanjo" width="500px">
          <p> 
              Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Monday, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, said democracy has not been working as a system of government in Africa because it was “forced” on the continent.
              Obasanjo stated this in his address at a high-level consultation on “Rethinking Western Liberal Democracy for Africa”.
              The former president said the Western style of democracy failed in Africa because it did not take into consideration the views of the majority of the people.
              Obasanjo described Western Liberal Democracy as a “government of a few people over all the people or population”.
              ”These few people are representatives of only some of the people and not full representatives of all the people.
              “Invariably, the majority of the people were wittingly or unwittingly kept out.

        <h2> Reactions as Sanwo-Olu approved N3.75bn for perfume, rechargeable fans </h2>
        <img src="/images/sanwolu.webp" alt="Sanwo-Olu" width="500px">
        <p> 
          Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has been widely criticised for approving N7.5 million to replace liquid fragrance in his office and N3 billion to purchase rechargeable fans for the office of his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat.

          Also, Nigerians reacted on social media to other contracts awarded by Lagos state’s Public Procurement Agency (PPA) in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2023 which included approval of over N440 million for the purchase of a new Lexus LX 600 Bulletproof Sport Utility Vehicle for use in the pool of Office of Chief of Staff.
